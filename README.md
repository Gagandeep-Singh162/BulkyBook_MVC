# My .NET 8 Web Application

Welcome to my .NET 8 Web Application project! This is a work-in-progress ASP.NET Core MVC application that I’m building from scratch to explore and master web development with .NET 8. So far, I’ve set up the foundation and implemented user authentication using the Identity Framework. This README will evolve as I add more features to the project.

## Project Overview

This is my take on a modern web application built with ASP.NET Core MVC and .NET 8. I started with the basics—setting up the project structure—and have worked my way up to integrating user authentication with the Identity Framework. My goal is to create a fully functional web app, and I’m documenting my journey here.

### Current Features
- **ASP.NET Core MVC Setup**: A clean, organized MVC structure built from the ground up with .NET 8.
- **User Authentication**: Implemented login and registration using the ASP.NET Core Identity Framework.
- **Database Foundation**: Set up Entity Framework Core with a code-first approach for future data operations.
- **Razor Views**: Basic Razor pages for user interaction, like login and registration forms.

### Future Plans
I’m excited to keep building and plan to add:
- CRUD functionality for managing data.
- A more complex app (maybe an online bookstore or similar).
- Cool features like custom UI components and secure user roles.

## Prerequisites

To run this project on your machine, you’ll need:
- **C# Basics**: I’ve been coding in C# for a few months, so some familiarity helps.
- **Visual Studio 2022**: My go-to IDE for this project.
- **SQL Server Management Studio**: For handling the database.
- **.NET 8 SDK**: Make sure you’ve got the latest .NET SDK installed.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gagandeep-Singh162/BulkyBook_MVC.git
